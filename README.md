1. Edit the index.html file. Notice it contains the head section of this page as well as a body section that contains a header element with some text, a main element, and a footer element with some text.

2. Use your text editor to open the content.txt file. This contains all of the text for the main element.

3. Code the img element that gets the image at the top of the page from the images folder. To locate the image file, use the document-relative path: image/town_hall_logo.gif. Be sure to include the alt attribute and set the height attribute to 80.

4. Apply the h2 and h3 elements to the text in the header element. 

5. Copy all of the content for the main element from the txt file into th HTML file. Then, add an h1 tag to the heading 'This Season's Guest Speakers'. Add h2 tags to the headings "Our Mission' and 'Our Ticket Packages'.
